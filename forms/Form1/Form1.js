/*
Git is a software that allows you to keep track of changes made to a 
program/project over time. Git works by recording the changes you make 
to a project - like a snapshot of your program at a given time. It stores
these. Then you can reference them, decide to make them a part of the 
'master' program/project, revert back to a previous one, etc. 

Git projects are usually managed on Github.com, a website that hosts 
Git projects. There you can access your projects by using the basic workflow
we'll be using and about which you read.

OK - here are the steps. I'll clarify terminology as we go along. 
1. Resave this appStudio project in a folder named Sept9GitHub and name it 
'HelloWorldGH'. Rename Form1 'hello'. Now run the project to make sure
there are not any problems.

alert("Hello World")
*/

/*
2. Now open GitHub Desktop. Click on Current Repository - then Create New Repository. 
This creats a new (local) GH project that will contain your appStudio project. 
** You must name the new repository with the same name as the appStudio project, including
the .appstudio file extension. 
So name the new repository: 'helloWorldGH.appstudio'.
